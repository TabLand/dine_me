I know the Maitre D'
You told me we could meetup
You won't pick up the phone, you're an asshole
I don't know you
Are you sure that's Paul Allen over there? 
Yes, McDufus, I am.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here
I'll pray for you
Am I seeing anyone?
Unfortunately I am, but do you want to take my number anyway? The more the merrier.
I can't give you the help and support you need right now but I can point you in the right direction. Is this making sense?
I don't think its a good idea for us to be friends anymore
I hope that you're ok and that things are going well for you.
I want to know you.
What does that mean, know me? know me?
Nobody knows anyone else, ever!
You will never, ever know me.
You do not know what a drag it is to see you right now.
You smell really good
but I don't know who you are.
Shut up. It's me.
Oh, of course. How are you?
How long have you been here? Why haven't you called?
This is embarrassing. I'm sorry
It's all right.
I don't have the slightest idea who you are right now.
Really, it's... it's totally blank.
Yeah, it is. Should I know you? 
It's great seeing you, really. 
Hey, man. 
Looks like it's gonna be a cold one. 
You know 
I find myself talking to you when you're not even around 
just carrying on conversations.
I wish you wouldn't tell me shit like that. 
But, Sean, I don't 
You've got the wrong idea. I don't want to be with you. 
What do you mean? 
No, I just want to know you. Just want to know who you are. 
Sean: No one will ever know anyone. 
You're not ever gonna know me. 
What the hell does that mean? 
It means, Paul, 
you're not ever gonna know me. 
Figure it out. Deal with it. 
Fuck you, Bateman.
